# Victoria Segments

![./sample.gif](./sample.gif)

Victoria Segments is a web-based platform that was envisioned to serve as a central hub for sharing and discovering short walks in the city of Victoria, BC.

Built with Next.js, React, Mapbox, and hosted on Vercel, the project was born out of a personal desire to curate high-quality daily activities within the city, and the website, victoria-segments.com, was intended to be an excellent resource for both locals and tourists. 

Despite the Victoria Tourism Bureau already building a similar website, they expressed appreciation for the concept. The development of Victoria Segments was not only an enjoyable journey but also a great learning experience with some of my favourite technologies!
